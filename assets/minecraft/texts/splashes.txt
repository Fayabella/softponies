Become pony.
I just don't know what went wrong!
Winter wrap up, winter wrap up.

What fun is there in making sense?
We're far apart, in every way
But you're the best part, of my day
And sure as I, breathe the air
I know we are, the perfect pair
On a prickly path that, goes on for miles
But it's worth it just, to see you smile
And I cannot be, pulled apart
From the hold you have on my heart
And even if, the world tells us it's wrong
You're in my head like a catchy song
The seasons change, and leaves may fall
But I'll be with you through them all
And rain or shine, you'll always be mine
You're the only one, who makes it all worthwhile
And you should not, blame me too

There is no escape.
Do you know you're all my very best friends?
Muffin?
You've come, such a long, long, way.
As long as we're still here together.

You've been kind for far too long, my dear.
I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
That box contains your wings.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak.
Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day.
Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
